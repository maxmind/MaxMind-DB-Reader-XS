NAME
    MaxMind::DB::Reader::XS - Fast XS implementation of MaxMind DB reader

VERSION
    version 0.060003

SYNOPSIS
        my $reader = MaxMind::DB::Reader->new( file => 'path/to/database.mmdb' );

        my $record = $reader->record_for_address('1.2.3.4');

DESCRIPTION
    Simply installing this module causes MaxMind::DB::Reader to use the XS
    implementation, which is much faster than the Perl implementation.

    The XS implementation links against the libmaxminddb
    <http://maxmind.github.io/libmaxminddb/> library.

    See MaxMind::DB::Reader for API details.
